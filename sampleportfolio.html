                  Hello! I'm an extremely driven and creative Full Stack Developer who is currently open for career opportunities as a front-end or back-end web developer in the Greater Seattle Area.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'm a recent graduate of Coding Dojo, a coding school located in Bellevue, WA that teaches 3 full stacks in 3 months. I'm capable of learning new technologies very quickly, and am always looking for opportunities to further expand my skills and grow as a developer.
